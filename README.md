## What Are AI Agents?

AI Agents are autonomous programs that can perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with their environment. They are powered by artificial intelligence and can be tailored to solve specific problems or automate workflows.

### Key Features of AI Agents:

- **Autonomy**: Operate independently without constant human intervention.
- **Adaptability**: Learn and improve over time.
- **Task-Oriented**: Focus on specific objectives or workflows.
- **Tool Integration**: Use external tools to enhance their capabilities.

## Tools in Agnarok

Tools are external functionalities or APIs that AI Agents can use to perform their tasks. In Agnarok, tools are:

- **Customizable**: Define what tools an agent can access.
- **Restricted**: Control access levels to ensure security and compliance.
- **Modular**: Easily add or remove tools based on the agent's requirements.

### Examples of Tools:

- **Data Fetching**: APIs for retrieving data from external sources.
- **File Management**: Access to file systems with restricted permissions.
- **Communication**: Integration with messaging platforms or email services.
